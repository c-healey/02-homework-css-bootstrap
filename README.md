## Development setup

This example is an aid and supplement to homework files to help you learn CSS and bootstrap. I encourage you to add the bonus features in the assignment.

- Navbar must be consistent on each page.

- Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

### Bonus

## How to submit your homework

- Github
  -- Create a Homework-XX Repo (XX = the homework assignment number)
  -- Select the clone button and copy the git url to your clipboard
- Terminal
  -- cd to your homework directory
  -- git clone (paste in git url)

Now you have an empty local repo to copy the homework starter files into. You should work on your homework in this directory and stage, commit and push often.
